To put things simply, React Navigation manages screens, navigation between them, and history as a Stack.

There's a default, initial screen that shows when the app is launched. Then, when you want to open a new screen, you can push it at the top of the stack or replace the current item in the stack.

Then, when you want to go backward, you pop the current item at the top of the stack and show the one below it, which was the previous screen, until you reach the home, initial screen.
